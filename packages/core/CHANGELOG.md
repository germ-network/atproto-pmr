## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [#30](https://github.com/germ-network/atproto-pmr/pull/30) [`f47481b`](https://github.com/germ-network/atproto-pmr/commit/f47481b01861138be218e5ac3025ea35be10f5e1) Thanks [@germ-mark](https://github.com/germ-mark)! - Re-registration with a different anchor key now deactivates and replaces the prior registration instead of refreshing the stored key in place. Same-key re-registration is unchanged (idempotent in-place refresh).

### Patch Changes

- [#28](https://github.com/germ-network/atproto-pmr/pull/28) [`bbaccf8`](https://github.com/germ-network/atproto-pmr/commit/bbaccf810ca951b18eaab9cd53320eb09b0bb324) Thanks [@germ-mark](https://github.com/germ-mark)! - Declaration watch: add the monotonic-rev watermark.

  `WatchState` gains the spec's "last observed declaration revision"
  (`lastObservedRev`, optional), and `applyDeclarationOutcome` refuses a
  `present`/`absent` whose observed repo rev is not strictly newer than the stored
  one — so a reordered or replayed recheck (Cloudflare Queues are unordered +
  at-least-once), or a PDS rev that moved backwards, cannot clobber a fresher
  pause decision. The decision is still made on the `currentKey` value; the rev is
  only an ordering token. `resolveDeclarationWithRev` reads that rev
  (`getLatestCommit`) on the recheck path only, never the hot pair-put path.
  `compareRev`/`RevComparison` and `fetchLatestRev` move to core as the single
  definition the monitor and the watch share.

### Patch Changes

- [#23](https://github.com/germ-network/atproto-pmr/pull/23) [`ade4873`](https://github.com/germ-network/atproto-pmr/commit/ade4873f39246c0dd9d5ac10435d0bd3880b292a) Thanks [@germ-mark](https://github.com/germ-mark)! - Add the own-DID declaration watch (pause-not-teardown).

  When the registration owner's own Germ declaration is **confirmed** to no longer
  carry its trusted anchor key — gone, or a different key — the registration
  **pauses** rather than tears down: DID-addressed (pair, and recovery-pool) mail
  is absorbed with the same uniform response a real append gives, grant-addressed
  mail keeps flowing, and it unpauses when the key returns. Absence is acted on
  only when confirmed, never inferred from a transient/unreachable PDS.

  - **core**: a `WatchState` and a `WatchOutcome` on `PMRStore`, with
    `readWatchState`/`writeWatchState` and `applyDeclarationOutcome` (the atomic
    read-modify-write of the paused flag); the pure decision logic in `watch.ts`
    (`classifyDeclaration`/`reconcileWatchState`); and a `confirmed` discriminator
    on `DeclarationResolution` (backed by a new optional `terminalErrorNames` on
    `guardedFetchJSON`) so a confirmed disappearance is distinguishable from a
    transient one. Pause enforcement is specified on `append`/`appendToPool`; the
    pair-put admission path is unchanged (it reads only `.found`).
  - **cloudflare**: `PMRObject` enforces the pause inside `append`/`appendToPool`
    (pair keys only — grant mail passes through) and implements
    `applyDeclarationOutcome`. It takes **no network dependency and schedules no
    work of its own**: the re-check is driven externally. A deployment re-fetches
    the declaration authoritatively (e.g. from a firehose-fed queue consumer) and
    calls `applyDeclarationOutcome`; a `MonitorIngest` subclass can drive it by
    overriding the existing `onChange`/`onRegression`/`onDelete` hooks. Mail
    already queued when a pause begins is left in place — pause is not teardown.
